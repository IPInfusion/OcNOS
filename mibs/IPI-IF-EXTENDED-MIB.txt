	DESCRIPTION 
		"
            The textual name of the interface. The value of this object should
            be the name of the interface as assigned by the local device and
            should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's
            `console'. This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple
            port number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax
            of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent
            a single interface as named by the device, then each will have the
            same value of name. Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP
            queries concerning an interface on some other (proxied) device,
            then the value of name for such an interface is the proxied
            device's local name for it. If there is no local name, or this
            object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a
            zero-length string.
