       "This table is an extension of the dot1agCfmMepTable and rows
        are automatically added or deleted from this table based upon row
        creation and destruction of the dot1agCfmMepTable.

        This table includes configuration attributes and
        operations for the proactive Ethernet OAM Fault Management
        and Performance Monitoring Continuity Check function
        (ETH-CC) as defined in Y.1731 and 802.1ag.

        ETH-CC can be used for the following applications:

        - Used to detect loss of continuity between any pair of
           MEPs in a MEG.

        - Used to detect unintended connectivity conditions and
          other defect conditions.

        The OAM PDU used for ETH-CC and ETH-RDI information is CCM.

        This table also includes configuration attributes for the
        Ethernet OAM Fault Management Remote Defect Indication
        function (ETH-RDI) as defined in Y.1731. ETH-RDI can be
        used for the following applications:

        - Single-ended fault management: The receiving MEP
          detects an RDI defect condition, which gets correlated
          with other defect conditions in this MEP and may become a
          fault cause. The absence of received ETH-RDI information
          in a single MEP indicates the absence of defects in the
          entire MEG.

        - Contribution to far-end performance monitoring: It
          reflects that there was a defect condition in the far end
          which is used as an input to the performance monitoring
          process.

        ETH-CC and ETH-RDI functions are only applicable to MEPs.

        This table includes configuration attributes and
        operations for the on-demand Ethernet OAM Fault Management
        Locked Signal function (ETH-LCK) as defined in Y.1731.
        ETH-LCK can be used for the following applications:

        - Used to communicate the administratively locking of a MEP
          and consequential interruption of data traffic forwarding
          toward the MEP expecting this traffic. This allows a MEP
          receiving ETH-LCK frames to distinguish between defect
          conditions and an administrative locking action.

        - Used by other OAM functions which require a MEP to be
          administratively locked, such as for out-of-service
          testing.

        The OAM PDU used for ETH-LCK information is LCK. VLAN encapsulation on
        the generated ETH-LCK PDU is application dependent and dependent upon
        the level on which it is generated.

        The writable objects in this table should be persistent
        upon reboot or restart of a device. It is not mandatory that they are
        persistent.

       "This table is an extension of the dot1agCfmMepTable and rows
        are automatically added or deleted from this table based upon row
        creation and destruction of the dot1agCfmMepTable

        This table includes configuration attributes and
        operations for the on-demand OAM Fault Management Test
        function (ETH-Test) defined in Y.1731. The OAM PDU used
        for ETH-Test information is TST. This
        function is only applicable to MEPs.

        The writable objects in this table need to be persistent
        upon reboot or restart of a device.

        Steps to use entries in this table:

        1) Wait for mefSoamTestOutStatus value to be false by the following
           sequence:
           a. an SNMP GET for both SnmpSetSerialNo (SNMPv2-MIB, RFC 3418) and
              mefSoamTestOutStatus objects (in same SNMP PDU).
           b. Check if value for mefSoamTestOutStatus is false.
              - if not, wait a second, go to step a above.
              - if yes, save the value of SnmpSetSerialNo and go
                to step 2) below
        2) Change mefSoamTestOutStatus value from false to true to ensure
           no other management entity will use the service. In order to
           avoid contention with other SNMP Managers, send an SNMP SET
           for both SnmpSetSerialNo and mefSoamTestOutStatus objects (in same
           SNMP PDU, and make sure SnmpSetSerialNo is the first varBind).
           For the SnmpSetSerialNo varBind, use the value that you obtained
           in step 1)a.. This ensures that two cooperating SNMP Managers will
           not step on each other's toes.
        3) Setup the different data to be sent and time to start, except do not
           set mefSoamTestOutEnabled.
        4) Record the current values of mefSoamTestNumIn,
           mefSoamTestNumInOutOfOrder, mefSoamTestNumInCrcErrors,
           mefSoamTestNumInBerErrors, mefSoamTestNumOut.
        5) Set mefSoamTestOutEnabled to a 'true' value to initiate
           transmission of ETH-Test messages.
        6) Monitor the value of mefSoamTestOutEnabled. When it is reset to
           false, the last TST frame has been transmitted.
        7) Compare mefSoamTestNumIn, mefSoamTestNumInOutOfOrder,
           mefSoamTestNumInCrcErrors, mefSoamTestNumInBerErrors,
           mefSoamTestNumOut to their old values from step 4, above, to get
           the results of the test.
        8) Change the mefSoamTestOutStatus value back to false to allow
           other management entities to use the table.
